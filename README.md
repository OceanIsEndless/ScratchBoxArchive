# ScratchBox Archive

This repo periodically saves all publicly available user-generated content from [ScratchBox](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchBox) in the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22ScratchBox%22&sort=-publicdate) for historical purposes.

## Why?

The following reasons are probably good ones:

* If the ScratchBox server fails or database corrupts, projects and metadata remain safe until service is restored. (Unlikely, but possible.)
* Projects could be edited, made private, or deleted at any time, so having an active archive helps preserve them. (Could also happen.)
* Why not? Archives are made few and far between, consist solely of public data, and do not cause any noticeable strain on the server.
* Because... lost media? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## How do I use this?

* If you want to see what the ScratchBox website looked like at a previous date, use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/https://scratchbox.grady.link/explore).
* If you want to download older versions of projects or any relevant metadata, see the [data backups](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22ScratchBox%22&sort=-publicdate).

## I don't want my project here!

Chill.

* If your project is private and you have not shared its link publicly, it is not here.
  * Private projects are inaccessible without their link.
* If your project is public or you have shared it with others, then it _might_ be here. BUT:
  * Remember, this is just a backup of ScratchBox.
    * By uploading and sharing your project online, you've already allowed it to be saved by third parties, such as this archive.
  * Removing your project from the Internet Archive is a rather cumbersome process.
    * I can remove it, but there's not much of a point in it unless you have a serious reason.

So don't worry about it! This archive is just a backup of ScratchBox, which you've already freely uploaded your project to. Nothing bad is going to happen as a result of your project being available in an archived state.
