# ScratchBox Archive

This repo periodically saves all publicly available user-generated content from [ScratchBox](https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchBox) in the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/@endless_ocean/lists/1/scratchbox-data-backups?sort=-date) for historical purposes.

## Why?

The following reasons are probably good ones:

* If the ScratchBox server fails or database corrupts, projects and metadata remain safe until service is restored. (Unlikely, but possible.)
* Projects could be edited, made private, or deleted at any time, so having an active archive helps preserve them. (Could also happen.)
* Why not? Archives are made few and far between, consist solely of public data, and do not cause any noticeable strain on the server.
* Because... lost media? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## How do I use this?

* If you want to see what the ScratchBox website looked like at a previous date, use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/https://scratchbox.grady.link/explore).
* If you want to download older versions of projects or any relevant metadata, see the [data backups](https://archive.org/details/@endless_ocean/lists/1/scratchbox-data-backups?sort=-date).

## I don't want my project here!

Chill.

* If your project is private and you have not shared its link publicly, it is not here.
  * Private projects are inaccessible without their link.
* If your project is public or you have shared its link with others, then it _might_ be here. BUT:
  * Remember, this is just a backup of ScratchBox.
    * By uploading and sharing your project online, you've already allowed it to be saved by third parties, such as this archive.
  * Removing your project from the Internet Archive is a rather cumbersome process.
    * I can remove it, but there's not much of a point in it unless you have a serious reason.

So don't worry about it! This archive is just a backup of ScratchBox, which you've already freely uploaded your project to. Nothing bad is going to happen as a result of your project being available in an archived state.

## Is this allowed?

I'm not really sure yet. But currently, the rules on the ScratchBox website **only prohibit *bots***, such as spam comment bots and whatnot. The API is perfectly free to use, though if it is free to use for this purpose I have yet to find confirmation.

> [!NOTE]
> I haven't really asked if anyone minds about this archive existing... sooooo if you mind then I can stop and/or take it down... I was kinda planning ahead for when ScratchBox gets bigger (an archive could be more important then), but I feel that it may seem weird for me to be archiving projects or user profiles at this point in time. I just wanted to make sure it stuck around. You never know when such things can go poof...

> Also, if it turns out that it ***is*** fine for this archive to exist **but** you *really* don't want your project here then I can of course remove it (just ask). It'll take me a little bit but I'll understand if you don't want your project(s) to be available anymore at some point in the future, and it's not like I'm going to stop you.

> But do remember that this is simply an archive, and the point of an archive is to archive stuff, so the less stuff removed from the archive, the better. I.e. be absolutely sure that you want it gone from the Internet forever (to the extent possible) before asking for it to be removed.
