# This is a list of IDs that are manually added to the archive.

# Whenever a backup is made of project data, public project IDs are automatically found in a list provided by the ScratchBox API.
# However, private projects are unlisted, meaning they cannot be discovered without having their IDs available ahead of time.

# There are some projects that might be set to private, but have been freely shared via link with others for viewing.
# The IDs of such projects are listed here so that they can be saved in the archive.
# All other private projects ARE NOT SAVED IN THE ARCHIVE! (To my dismay.)
# So don't worry. Your private project is 100% secure with ScratchBox.
# As long as you don't share the link publicly, it will remain hidden.
